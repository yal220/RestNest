<H1> RestNest <H1>
<P> Have you ever been on a long plane trip with a layover of several hours? Have you ever had your plane delayed, such that you have had to sleep in the airport for over 5 hours?  What did you do? Did you try to sleep on a bench? Did you find a chair that was sort of comfortable? Did you stay awake the whole time walking around the airport, or did you try to sleep on one of the hard benches?  Those are ineffective ways to sleep in airports. <p>
<P> RestNest provides a low-cost, low-stress enviroment for travelers to rest, relax and recharge during a long time layover at the airport.<P>
